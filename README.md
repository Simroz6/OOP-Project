1. Introduction
Background
As technology advances, traditional voting systems need to improve. In this project, we
developed a secure online voting system using C++. It includes key features like user login,
voting, and result display.
Problem Statement
Old voting methods can lead to problems like double voting, lack of security, and manual
counting mistakes. Our goal is to solve these problems by creating a secure and automated
voting platform.
Objectives
 Stop duplicate voting using secure logins
 Provide an easy-to-use voting interface
 Show results and count votes in real time

2. Project Scope
What’s Included:
 Login system for Admin and Voters using classes
 A simple text-based interface for voting and viewing results
 Real-time vote counting

What’s Not Included:
 Blockchain for extra security
 Fingerprint or biometric login
 Support for multiple languages
 File or database-based vote storage

3. Project Description
Overview
We used Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts:
 Encapsulation: Private user data and vote counts
 Inheritance: Admin and Voter are based on the User class
 Polymorphism: The display () function acts differently for each class
Technical Requirements
 Language: C++
 IDE: Visual Studio Code
 Interface: Text-based (Raylib or SFML can be added later)
Project Steps:
1. Research existing voting systems
2. Design class structures (User, Admin, Voter, Candidate)
3. Code login and voting features
4. Test vote casting, login, and user removal
5. Write the report and prepare demo

4. Methodology
Approach
 We followed an Agile method, improving step-by-step
 Each part was designed as a separate OOP module

Teamwork

Both members worked together equally on coding, testing, design, and documentation

5. Expected Outcomes
Final Deliverables:
 A working voting system prototype
 Full project report and technical documents
 Test cases showing that login and voting features work
Why It Matters:
This project is similar to real-world online voting systems. It shows how OOP can be used to
make secure, reliable software.

6. Resources Used
Software Tools:
 Visual Studio Code
 Optional GUI: Raylib or SFML
